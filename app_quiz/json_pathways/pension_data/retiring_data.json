This tends to be age 60-65, but can be as early as 55.\n\nYou can choose to take up to 25% of your pension as a sum tax-free, and receive the rest as regular taxed income. This is called annuity, and is a permanent decision - you can’t change your mind and take it out as one sum later on.\n\nAlternatively, you can leave an amount of your pension in savings and take it out as a sum at a later date. This is called drawdown."
